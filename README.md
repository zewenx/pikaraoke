# PiKaraoke

PiKaraoke is a "KTV"-style karaoke song search and queueing system. It connects to your TV, and shows a QR code for computers and smartphones to connect to a web interface. From there, multiple users can seamlessly search your local track library, queue up songs, add an endless selection of new karaoke tracks from YouTube, and more. Works on Raspberry Pi, OSX, Windows, and Linux!

If you want to support this project with a little monetary tip, it's much appreciated: <br/>

## Supported Devices

This _should_ work on all raspberry pi devices, but multi-core models recommended. I did most development on a Pi Zero W and did as much optimization as I could handle, so it will work. However, certain things like concurrent downloads and browsing big song libraries will suffer. All this runs excellently on a Pi 3 and above.

Also works on macs, PCs, and linux!

## Installation

### Pre-built Raspberry Pi image

If you're on a Raspberry Pi, you might want to just use the pre-built image to save time installing dependencies:

- Download the zip file of the raspberrry pi image and extract it: [latest release]( https://github.com/vicwomg/pikaraoke/releases/latest)
- Write the image to an SD card. [Instructions on how to install pi img files](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/)
- Before plugging it in, configure your wifi
  - Reconnect the SD card on the computer you used to flash the file
  - In the /boot drive that shows up, make a copy of wpa_supplicant.conf.example to wpa_supplicant.conf
  - Edit this wpa_supplicant.conf and replace with your wifi router's ssid, password, and if necessary, the country code. Save the file
- Plug in the SD card to your pi device and turn it on
- You should eventually see the Pikaraoke splash screen
- On your phone, connect to the IP address on the screen (or use the QR code). 
- In the web interface, go to the "Pikaraoke" submenu in the titlebar. 
  - Click the link to update youtube-dl and give it a couple of minutes to complete
  - Click the link to expand the Raspberry Pi filesystem to fill the rest of your SD card
- Pi will reboot. You should be all set!
- The credentials to log in to the pi are - username: pi / password: pikaraoke

### Manual install

Install git, if you haven't already. (on raspberry pi: `sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install git`)
Install python3/pip3 (usually raspberry pis already have it, run `python3 --version` to check): https://www.python.org/downloads/ (python 2.7 may work, but is not officially supported)

Clone this repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/vicwomg/pikaraoke.git
cd pikaraoke
```

#### Raspberry pi

Run the setup script:

```
./setup-pi.sh
```

You will then probably need to reboot since this changes a boot setting (gpu_mem=128). This is to prevent certain videos from showing visual artifacts (green pixel distortion)

```
sudo reboot
```

#### Linux / OSX

- Install VLC (to its default location): https://www.videolan.org/
- Install ffmpeg (only if you want to use --high-quality flag) https://ffmpeg.org/download.html

Install requirements from the pikaraoke directory:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
pip3 install --upgrade youtube_dl
```

#### Windows

- Install VLC (to its default location): https://www.videolan.org/
- Install ffmpeg (only if you want to use --high-quality flag) https://ffmpeg.org/download.html
- Install MS Visual C++ (required to launch youtube-dl)  https://www.microsoft.com/en-US/download/details.aspx?id=5555
- Install youtube-dl.exe. FYI, pip3 didn't seem to work for this on windows, so I used scoop as a package manager and I think it handles filed permissions best. Install scoop by following the instructions here: https://scoop.sh/

```
scoop install youtube-dl
```

Open a powershell, and go to the pikaraoke directory:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Note: if you have trouble installing pygame, there's apparently an incompatibility with Python 3.8. Try upgrading to the latest python version or downgrading to 3.7.

## Launch

cd to the pikaraoke directory and run:

`sudo python3 app.py` (pi devices) or `python3 app.py` (other)

You must run as sudo on pi devices if you are running directly from the console since PiKaraoke uses pygame to control the screen buffer. You can probably run as non-sudo from the Raspbian desktop environment, but may need to specify a different download directory than the default with the -d option.

The app should launch and show the PiKaraoke splash screen and a QR code and a URL. Using a device connected to the same wifi network as the Pi, scan this QR code or enter the URL into a browser. You are now connected! You can start exploring the UI and adding/queuing new songs directly from YouTube.

## Auto-start PiKaraoke

This is optional, but you may want to make your raspberry pi a dedicated karaoke device. If so, add the following to your /etc/rc.local file (paths and arguments may vary) to always start pikaraoke on reboot.

```
# start pikaraoke on startup
/usr/bin/python3 /home/pi/pikaraoke/app.py &
```

Or if you're like me and want some logging for aiding debugging, the following stores output at: /var/log/pikaraoke.log:

```
# start pikaraoke on startup / logging
/usr/bin/python3 /home/pi/pikaraoke/app.py >> /var/log/pikaraoke.log 2>&1 &
```

Another option is to only launch if there's a valid IP detected during startup, that way pikaraoke wont hijack your pi if it can't get connected:

```
_IP=$(hostname -I) || true
if [ "$_IP" ]; then
  printf "My IP address is %s\n" "$_IP"
  /usr/bin/python3 /home/pi/pikaraoke/app.py >> /var/log/pikaraoke.log 2>&1 &
fi
```

If you want to kill the pikaraoke process, you can do so from the PiKaraoke Web UI under: `Info > Quit pikaraoke`. Or you can ssh in and run `sudo killall python` or something similar.

Note that if your wifi/network is inactive pikaraoke will error out 10 seconds after being launched. This is to prevent the app from hijacking your ability to login to repair the connection.

                        and cdg support wont be available. Note: if you want
                        to play audio to the headphone jack on a rpi, you'll
                        need to configure this in raspi-config: 'Advanced
                        Options > Audio > Force 3.5mm (headphone)'
  --use-vlc             Use VLC Player to play video. Enabled by default.
                        Note: if you want to play audio to the headphone jack

                        Path to a custom logo image file for the splash
                        screen. Recommended dimensions ~ 500x500px
  --show-overlay        Show overlay on top of video with pikaraoke QR code
                        and IP
  --admin-password ADMIN_PASSWORD
                        Administrator password, for locking down certain
                        features of the web UI such as queue editing, player
                        controls, song editing, and system shutdown. If
                        unspecified, everyone is an admin.
  --developer-mode      Run in flask developer mode. Only useful for tweaking
                        the web UI in real time. Will disable the splash
                        screen due to pygame main thread conflicts and may
                        require FLASK_ENV=development env variable for full
                        dev mode features.
```

## Screen UI

Upon launch, the connected monitor/TV should show a splash screen with the IP of PiKaraoke along with a QR code.

If there's a keyboard attached, you can exit pikaraoke by pressing "esc". You can toggle fullscreen mode by pressing "f"

Make sure you are connected to the same network/wifi. You can then enter the shown IP or scan the QR code on your smartphone/tablet/computer to open it in a browser. From there you should see the PiKaraoke web interface. It is hopefully pretty self-explanatory, but if you really need some help:

## Web UI

### Home

- View Now Playing and Next tracks
- Access controls to repeat, pause, skip and control volume 
- Transpose slider to change playback pitch

### Queue

- Edit the queue/playlist order (up and down arrow icons)
- Delete from queue ( x icon )
- Add random songs to the queue
- Clear the queue

### Songs

- Add songs to the queue by searching current library on local storage (likely empty at first), search is executed autocomplete-style
- Add new songs from the internet by using the second search box
- Click browse to view the full library. From here you can edit files in the library (rename/delete).

### Info

- Shows the IP and QR code to share with others
- Shows CPU / Memory / Disk Use stats
- Allows updating the song list and youtube-dl version
- Allows user to quit to console, shut down, or reboot system. Always shut down from here before you pull the plug on pikaraoke!

## Troubleshooting

### I'm not hearing audio out of the headphone jack

By default the raspbian outputs to HDMI audio when it's available. Pikaraoke tries to output to both HDMI and headphone, but if it doesn't work you may need to to force it to the headphone jack. This is definitely the case when using VLC. To do so, change following setting on the pi:
`sudo raspi-config`
Advanced Options > Audio > Force 3.5mm (headphone)

See: https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/audio-config.md

If you're still having issues with hearing audio, it has been reported this helps on raspberry pi 4 devices:

`sudo nano /usr/share/alsa/alsa.conf`

Scroll down and change defaults.ctl.card and defaults.pcm.card to "1"

```
defaults.ctl.card 1
defaults.pcm.card 1
```

Note this value might be different in older versions of Raspbian or if you have external audio hardware. See source article for details: https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/a/39942

### I'm still having audio issues with the headphone jack, external sound card, or other audio device with omxplayer

If using omxplayer with `--use-omxplayer`, it tends to have some inconsistent results across different hardware combinations. Try experimenting with the --adev option, which specifies the audio device to omxplayer. Defaults to 'both' which is hdmi and headphone out. Other possible values are: hdmi/local/both/alsa[:device].

If you're hearing distorted audio output, try '--adev alsa' with omxplauer.

If you're using an external USB sound card or hifi audio hat like the hifiberry, you'll need to add the argument '--adev alsa:hw:0,0' when you launch pikaraoke

### Songs aren't downloading!

Make sure youtube-dl is up to date, old versions have higher failure rates due to security changes in Youtube. You can see your current version installed by navigating to `Info > System Info > Youtube-dl version`. The version number is usually the date it was released. If this is older than a couple of months, chances are it will need an update.

You can update youtube-dl directly from the web UI. Go to `Info > Update Youtube-dl` (depending on how you installed, you may need to be running pikaraoke as sudo for this to work)

Or, from the CLI (path may vary):
`youtube-dl -U`

### Downloads are slow!

youtube-dl is very CPU intensive, especially for single-core devices like the pi models zero and less-than 2. The more simultaneous downloads there are, the longer they will take. Try to limit it to 1-2 at a time. Pi 3 can handle quite a bit more.

### I brought my pikaraoke to a friend's house and it can't connect to their network. How do I change wifi connection without ssh?

These are my preferred ways to do it, but they might require either a USB keyboard or a computer with an SD Card reader.

- _Completely Headless_: I can highly recommend this package: https://github.com/jasbur/RaspiWiFi . Install it according to the directions and it will detect when there is no network connection and act as a Wifi AP allowing you to configure the wifi connection from your smartphone, similar to a Chromecast initial setup. You can even wire up a button to GPIO18 and 3.3V to have a manual wifi reset button. This, along with auto-launch in rc.local makes PiKaraoke a standalone appliance!
- _USB Keyboard_: plug in a USB keyboard to the pi. After it boots up, log in and run "sudo raspi-config" and configure wifi through the Network Options section. If the desktop UI is installed, you can also run "startx" and configure wifi from the Raspbian GUI. You can also manually edit /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf as desribed below.
- _SD Card Reader_: Remove the pi's SD card and open it on a computer with an SD card reader. It should mount as a disk drive. On the BOOT partition, add a plaintext file named "wpa_supplicant.conf" and put the following in it:

```
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1
country=<Your 2-letter country code, ex. US>
network={
  ssid="<the wifi ap ssid name>"
  psk="<the wifi password>"
  key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
}
```

Add the SD card back to the pi and start it up. On boot, Raspbian should automatically add the wpa_supplicant.conf file to the correct location and connect to wifi.

### Can I run PiKaraoke without a wifi/network connection?

Actually, yes! But you can only access your existing library and won't be able to download new songs, obviously.

If you run your pi as a wifi access point, your browser can connect to that access point, and it should work. See: https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless/access-point.md

Or an even easier approach, if you install this: https://github.com/jasbur/RaspiWiFi (used for configuring wifi connections headless, see above). While it's in AP mode, you can connect to the pi as an AP and connect directly to it at http://10.0.0.1:5000

### Where do I plug in a microphone?

Ideally, you'd have a mixer and amplifier that you could run the line out of the pi to, as well as the microphones. I used this affordable wireless microphone set from amazon: https://amzn.to/2OXKXdc (affiliate link) It has a line-in so you can also run PiKaraoke into the mix, and output to an amplifier.

The pi doesn't have a hardware audio input. Technically, you should be able to run a microphone through it with a USB sound card attached to the pi, but I personally wouldn't bother due to latency and audio quality issues.

### How do I change song pitch/key?

While a song is playing, the home screen of the web interface will show a transpose slider. Slide it up or down based on your preference and press the "ok" button to restart the song in the given key.

If you don't see this option, you may be running the `--use-omxplayer` option. Omxplayer does not support key change.

### How do I add cdg or mp3+cdg zip files?

You'll need to add them manually by copying them to the root of your download folder. Run `python app.py --help` and look under DOWNLOAD_PATH to find out what the default folder is, or specify your own. Only cdg/mp3 pairs and .zip files are supported.

### My mp3/cdg file is not playing

CDG files must have an mp3 file with a exact matching file name. They can also be bundled together in a single zip file, but the filenames in the zip must still match. They must also be placed in the root of the download directory and not stashed away in sub-directories. 

If you only hear audio, you may be running the `--use-omxplayer` option. Omxplayer does not support cdg.

### I'm on a laptop, how do I output just pikaraoke to an external monitor/screen?

You might be able to just drag the windows to the target screen (press 'f' to toggle fullscreen). But in my experience there can be issues figuring out which monitor to use once videos start playing. For now you'd probably have the most consistent experience using single-screen mirrored mode.
